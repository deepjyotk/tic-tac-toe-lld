# Tic-Tac-Toe Low Level Design

## Overview

This project presents a low-level design for a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. It consists of three main classes: `game.py`, `board.py`, and `person.py`, utilizing the builder design pattern to construct the players involved in the game.

## Key Takeaways

- Implementation of the builder design pattern to create player instances in a Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- Separation of concerns demonstrated through the use of distinct classes for game logic (`game.py`), game board representation (`board.py`), and player attributes (`person.py`).
- Encapsulation of game mechanics and player management, showcasing object-oriented programming principles in Python.

## Project Structure

- `game.py`: Contains the main game logic and controls the flow of the game.
- `board.py`: Manages the game board, including displaying the board and checking for win conditions.
- `person.py`: Defines the player properties and behaviors, constructed using the builder pattern.

## Running the Project

To run this Tic-Tac-Toe game, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run:

```bash
python game.py
```

This command will start the game in your terminal.
